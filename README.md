# Pico ADC Acquisition trough SPI Transmission

This project implements real-time data acquisition of a 16-bit parallel ADC (ADS8405) using a Raspberry Pi Pico.  

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040)
- ADS8405 16-bit ADC
- CMake and Pico SDK
- Raspberry Pi (or equivalent) as SPI master to pull out data
